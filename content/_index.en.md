![solid](solid.png)

### S (Single-responsiblity principle)
One class should have one and only one responsibility

### O (Open-closed principle)
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### L (Liskov substitution principle)
Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.

### I (Interface segregation principle)
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### D (Dependency Inversion Principle)
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions.
